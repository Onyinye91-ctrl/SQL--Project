## Introduction:
The Covid_19 pandemic has wreaked havoc and led to the dramatic loss of life and
livelihood. Its impact continues to affect the way in which we live and interact. In

database instead of String.
4. Load the Covid_19_data.csv file into mysql database.


## Task:
1. Load the Covid_19 csv data into a table in a mysql Database. 
2. Write suitable sql queries to analyze and generate insight from the data.
Below are the questions you are to write SQL queries to find answers to:
  * Retrieve the total number of records in the data you loaded to the database
  * Retrieve the records for the following observation dates - 1/22/2020, 
     1/27/2020, 1/31/2020
3. Retrieve a summary of all the records. This should include the following
